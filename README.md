# CoffeeOrder

## Features 
A single screen app made using Relative Layout nested inside Linear Layout which works as a root layout. There are 2 view groups used: 
1. Text view 
2. Button view 

On pressing the + button ( increment) it adds a cup of coffee in your order and similarly removes a cup of coffee when - button (decrement). Finally clicking the order button displays the amount of money to be paid for the desired number of cups ( for eg if each cup costs 5 then total should be 30 for 6 cups) .
